  ## Usage instructions
  
  Once your device joins the fleet you'll need to allow some time for it to download the application.

  On your router or DHCP server assign a static IP to your Pi-hole device, and set your clients DNS to the same IP address.
  
  If your DNS is configured correctly you will be able to access the Pi-hole dashboard at http://pi.hole/admin/. The default password is `balena`.
